| Description       | Similar to JS runtime integrations. The server composes the components, assembles the final view and the resulting app is served to the client at runtime. Each app can be rendered completely on its own. No need for the container (final) application.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Pre-requisites    | Each app on its standalone server                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Strengths         | Mobile clients usually have a slower internet connection so they benefit from the smaller payload to download. They also have less computing power so they profit from the pre-rendered HTML.  Easy to set up – HTTP servers and caches are part of every web application architecture.  Full independence of deployments With the same stack, only the main node needs to do SSR                                                 |
| Drawbacks         | Lack of cross-component communication – it must be solved another way Hard to achieve a consistent UX look & feel Lack of built-in authentication and authorization. With different stacks, all nodes need to do SSR. Adamant to delegate caching to the CDN whenever possible If the page is highly cacheable, it will then be served by the CDN with a long time-to-live (TTL) policy.  A/B testing hard to config in CDN |
| Use Cases         | Catalogs, newspapers, eCommerce like web applications when microservices with less fluctuating application and services architecture. Useful when you want full control of the application. Interest in SEO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Recommended Techs | Tech Implementation:  SSI (NGINX, Apache HTTP) ESI (Varnish, Squid) SSR-friendly frameworks, like Nuxt.js (Vue.js), Next.js (React.js).Description  Publish each micro frontend as a package. Generate a single final bundle for distribution.  GraphQL and cache data hydration                                                                                                                                                  |
